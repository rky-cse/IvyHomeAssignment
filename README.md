# IvyHomeAssignment
1. Initial API Exploration and Observations
You began by testing the API endpoints using tools like Postman. For example:

v1 Endpoint Test:
You called:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v1/autocomplete?query=a
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v1",
    "count": 10,
    "results": [
        "aa",
        "aabdknlvkc",
        "aabrkcd",
        "aadgdqrwdy",
        "aagqg",
        "aaiha",
        "aainmxg",
        "aajfebume",
        "aajwv",
        "aakfubvxv"
    ]
}
Observation:

The API returns at most 10 suggestions when queried with a prefix.
If you try a more specific query such as http://34.47.238.26:8000/v1/autocomplete?query=abc, the response might contain fewer suggestions (for example, only 1 result), which tells you that the branch of the search tree is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù for that prefix.
v2 Endpoint Test:
You called:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v2/autocomplete?query=a
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v2",
    "count": 12,
    "results": [
        "a0",
        "a09p36zjy",
        "a0d2vhq3i",
        "a0ft3ec1tl",
        "a0lnv81gm",
        "a0pnt1",
        "a0qm",
        "a0twzs6",
        "a1nvj3fpg",
        "a1x1",
        "a2",
        "a2cqmcc7"
    ]
}
Observation:

Here, strings can include digits as well as letters.
The maximum number of results for v2 is 12.
A result count lower than 12 implies that no further suggestions exist beyond that prefix.
v3 Endpoint Test:
You called:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v3/autocomplete?query=a
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v3",
    "count": 15,
    "results": [
        "a",
        "a e+skbrns",
        "a ifs1.-",
        "a+woz7",
        "a-.",
        "a-g z",
        "a-m.ffwo",
        "a-o80",
        "a.",
        "a.-gowx3d",
        "a..rmw83",
        "a.1kh g",
        "a.2xf",
        "a.c",
        "a.gi3m"
    ]
}
Observation:

The response for v3 shows that strings may include not only letters and digits, but also symbols such as dot (.), plus (+), minus (-), and even spaces.
The maximum count for v3 is 15.
2. Problem Challenge and Exponential Search Space
From these observations, you recognized a significant challenge:

Exhaustive Search Impracticality:
If you try to generate every possible string (for example, using only lowercase letters for v1), the total number of potential queries would be exponential.
For instance, if the maximum string length is unknown and assumed to be n, then you have 
26
ùëõ
26 
n
  combinations for v1, 
36
ùëõ
36 
n
  for v2 (letters + digits), and 
40
ùëõ
40 
n
  for v3 (letters, digits, and additional symbols).
However, you also noted an important fact:

Finiteness of the Server Data:
Although the search space is exponentially large, the set of valid names stored on the server is finite.
Key Pruning Insight:
When a query returns fewer results than the maximum count for that API version (i.e., less than 10 for v1, less than 12 for v2, and less than 15 for v3), you can be certain that no additional suggestions exist that extend that particular prefix.
This fact serves as a base case for your search: there is no need to further explore that branch.
3. Optimizing the Search Approach
Based on these insights, you designed a strategy with the following elements:

Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Start with a minimal query (a single allowed character) and progressively extend it.
For each query:
If the API returns the maximum number of suggestions for that version, you assume that there might be more strings available with that prefix. Therefore, you extend the query by appending every allowed character.
If the API returns fewer than the maximum suggestions, you stop extending that branch (prune it), as no additional results exist.
Allowed Character Sets per Version:

v1: Use only lowercase letters (a‚Äìz).
v2: Use lowercase letters and digits (a‚Äìz and 0‚Äì9).
v3: Use lowercase letters, digits, and additional symbols (dot, plus, minus, space).
Pruning Based on Response Count:

If the result count is below the maximum count for that version, then that branch is complete and does not need further extension.
Additional Pruning Idea:

(In another variant you experimented with) If the exact set of suggestions for a given query has been seen before, then further extending that branch can be skipped. This avoids redundant API calls.
Efficiency:

This method avoids a brute-force exploration of the entire exponential search space by only extending those queries where the server‚Äôs response indicates there could be more names hidden behind a generic prefix.
4. Implementation and Separate Solutions for Each API Version
Given these considerations, you proceeded to implement three separate scripts (or three variants in one codebase) that each handle a specific API version with its own allowed character set and maximum result count:

Version v1:
Endpoint: http://34.47.238.26:8000/v1/autocomplete?query={query}
Allowed Characters: Only lowercase letters (26 possibilities).
Maximum Results: 10 per query.
Search Strategy:
Begin with each letter a‚Äìz.
Extend the query only if exactly 10 results are returned.
Prune when fewer than 10 suggestions are received.
Version v2:
Endpoint: http://34.47.238.26:8000/v2/autocomplete?query={query}
Allowed Characters: Lowercase letters and digits (36 possibilities).
Maximum Results: 12 per query.
Search Strategy:
Start with all allowed characters.
Only extend a query if the API returns exactly 12 suggestions.
Stop further extension if fewer than 12 are returned.
Version v3:
Endpoint: http://34.47.238.26:8000/v3/autocomplete?query={query}
Allowed Characters: Lowercase letters, digits, dot (.), plus (+), minus (-), and space (40 possibilities).
Maximum Results: 15 per query.
Search Strategy:
Initiate the search with each allowed character.
Extend a query only if exactly 15 suggestions are returned.
Prune the branch if fewer than 15 are returned.
For each version, the code performs the following:

API Call: Makes a GET request to the appropriate endpoint.
Response Handling:
Parses the JSON response.
Extracts the number of suggestions (count) and the list of suggestions.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Uses a queue initialized with all allowed characters.
Processes each query from the queue and, based on the returned count, decides whether to extend the query further.
Result Aggregation:
Adds each unique suggestion to a set.
Tracks the number of API calls made.
File Output:
Writes the final list of discovered names (without including the lengths) along with the total number of names and API calls made into a separate file for each version.
5. Final Thoughts and Summary
The solution came together by:

Testing the API endpoints and observing differences in behavior across versions.
Recognizing that the maximum number of suggestions returned (10, 12, or 15) acts as a natural boundary for each query prefix.
Realizing that the server contains a finite number of names, so the search space is manageable if pruned intelligently.
Designing a BFS-based search that only extends a query when the maximum number of suggestions is returned.
Customizing the allowed characters for each API version according to the observations:
v1: Only a‚Äìz
v2: a‚Äìz plus digits
v3: a‚Äìz, digits, and symbols (., +, -, space)
Implementing three separate solutions and documenting each one clearly.
This systematic approach ensures you cover all possible names stored on the server without an impractical number of API calls, leveraging the hints provided by the API‚Äôs response structure.

By detailing every step, observation, and reasoning behind the solution, you not only developed an efficient search algorithm but also ensured that each API version is handled with its unique constraints and requirements.

Reasoned for a second
Below is a comprehensive narrative written from my perspective that explains how I came up with the solution, including all my observations, hints, and the step‚Äêby‚Äêstep reasoning process for designing the approach for v1, v2, and v3.

My Process and Observations
Initial Exploration with Postman
I started by testing the API endpoints using Postman. My first test was with version v1:

v1 API Test:
I made a call to:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v1/autocomplete?query=a
The response I received was:
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v1",
    "count": 10,
    "results": [
        "aa",
        "aabdknlvkc",
        "aabrkcd",
        "aadgdqrwdy",
        "aagqg",
        "aaiha",
        "aainmxg",
        "aajfebume",
        "aajwv",
        "aakfubvxv"
    ]
}
Observation:
The API returns at most 10 suggestions when queried with a prefix.
I also noticed that if I use a more specific prefix like "abc", the result count could be less (for example, only 1 result for http://34.47.238.26:8000/v1/autocomplete?query=abc). This indicated to me that if a query returns fewer than 10 suggestions, then that prefix is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù and no further names exist with that beginning.
Next, I explored version v2:

v2 API Test:
I made a call to:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v2/autocomplete?query=a
The response was:
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v2",
    "count": 12,
    "results": [
        "a0",
        "a09p36zjy",
        "a0d2vhq3i",
        "a0ft3ec1tl",
        "a0lnv81gm",
        "a0pnt1",
        "a0qm",
        "a0twzs6",
        "a1nvj3fpg",
        "a1x1",
        "a2",
        "a2cqmcc7"
    ]
}
Observation:
In v2, strings may include digits as well as letters.
The maximum number of suggestions here is 12.
Again, if I got fewer than 12 suggestions, I could conclude that the prefix had been ‚Äúfully explored.‚Äù
Then I moved on to version v3:

v3 API Test:
I tested by calling:
http://34.47.238.26:8000/v3/autocomplete?query=a
And I received:
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "version": "v3",
    "count": 15,
    "results": [
        "a",
        "a e+skbrns",
        "a ifs1.-",
        "a+woz7",
        "a-.",
        "a-g z",
        "a-m.ffwo",
        "a-o80",
        "a.",
        "a.-gowx3d",
        "a..rmw83",
        "a.1kh g",
        "a.2xf",
        "a.c",
        "a.gi3m"
    ]
}
Observation:
v3 returns up to 15 suggestions.
I also saw that strings in v3 can include not only lowercase letters and digits, but also symbols such as dot (.), plus (+), minus (-), and even spaces.
The Challenge and How I Optimized the Search
I realized that if I tried an exhaustive search for all possible strings, the number of potential queries would be astronomical. For instance:

For v1 with only letters, if the maximum length is n, I‚Äôd have 
26
ùëõ
26 
n
  combinations.
For v2, using letters plus digits, that‚Äôs 
36
ùëõ
36 
n
 .
For v3, with letters, digits, and four additional symbols, it would be 
40
ùëõ
40 
n
 .
Despite the exponential nature of the search space, I knew the server‚Äôs database of names was finite. Here‚Äôs where a critical observation came in:

Key Insight:
When I receive a response that returns fewer than the maximum count (i.e., less than 10 for v1, less than 12 for v2, or less than 15 for v3), I can safely assume that no further names exist with that prefix. This acts as a natural ‚Äúbase case‚Äù that allows me to prune my search.
So my strategy was:

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
Start with minimal queries (each allowed character) and then extend only those prefixes that return the maximum number of results.

If the response count equals the maximum, it implies that there might be additional names available by extending that prefix.
If it‚Äôs less than the maximum, I stop extending that branch.
Allowed Character Sets:

v1: Only lowercase letters (a‚Äìz).
v2: Lowercase letters plus digits (a‚Äìz and 0‚Äì9).
v3: Lowercase letters, digits, and additional symbols (dot, plus, minus, space).
Additional Considerations:
I even thought about pruning further by not expanding a prefix if I‚Äôd already seen the exact same set of results from another query, thereby avoiding redundant API calls.

Implementing the Final Solution
With all these insights, I built three separate solutions for v1, v2, and v3. Each solution follows a similar structure:

API Call:
I send a GET request to the appropriate endpoint with the query string.

Response Processing:
I parse the JSON to get the list of suggestions and the count.

If the count equals the maximum for that version (10, 12, or 15), I extend the query by appending every allowed character.
If the count is less than the maximum, I know that branch is complete.
BFS Implementation:
I initialize a queue with each allowed character as a starting query. Then I use BFS to explore the query space. Unique suggestions are added to a set, ensuring that I only keep new names.

File Output:
I write the final results (the total number of names and the list of names) into a file, without including the length of each string.

My Final Implementations
Below are the final Python implementations and documentation for each version.

    write_results_v3(names, total_requests)
Final Reflection
In summary, I approached the problem by:

Testing each API version and noting the maximum results per query.
Recognizing that if a query returned fewer results than the maximum, that branch was complete.
Using a breadth-first search strategy that only extended queries when the server indicated more results might exist.
Customizing the allowed character sets according to the specific API version.
Implementing separate solutions for v1, v2, and v3 while outputting the results to files without printing the lengths of the strings.
This structured and optimized approach allowed me to efficiently retrieve all names from the server without an exponential number of API calls, relying on the finite nature of the stored data and the natural pruning offered by the API responses.
